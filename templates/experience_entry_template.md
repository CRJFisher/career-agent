## ATS Optimization Tips

1. Mirror keywords from job description naturally
2. Include both spelled out and abbreviated terms (e.g., "Artificial Intelligence (AI)")
3. Use standard job titles even if internal title was different
4. Quantify everything possible (percentages, dollar amounts, time saved, scale)
5. Avoid special characters or symbols that ATS might not parse
6. Include both technical skills and soft skills in achievements
