3. Draw explicit connections to their requirements
4. Reference their current challenges or initiatives

### Examples:

**Matching Technical Requirements:**
"In my current role as Lead Engineer at Netflix, I architected a microservices platform that reduced system latency by 40% while handling 10x traffic growth. This experience directly aligns with Uber's need for engineers who can optimize real-time systems at massive scale. I noticed your engineering blog post about moving to a cell-based architecture â€“ I implemented a similar pattern that improved our service isolation and reduced blast radius during incidents by 60%."

**Demonstrating Problem-Solving:**
"When our team faced similar challenges to what Airbnb described in your recent article about search relevance, I led the implementation of a machine learning pipeline that improved booking conversion by 25%. Using technologies from your stack including Spark and TensorFlow, we processed 50TB of daily search data to deliver personalized results in under 100ms. This experience has prepared me to contribute immediately to Airbnb's search ranking team."

**Showing Leadership Impact:**
"At Salesforce, I transformed an underperforming team into one of the highest-rated engineering teams in the company. By implementing agile practices tailored to our enterprise constraints and establishing clear career growth paths, I improved team retention by 90% and delivery velocity by 3x. Given DocuSign's recent expansion and focus on engineering excellence mentioned in your Q3 earnings call, I'm confident I can help scale your engineering culture while maintaining quality."
