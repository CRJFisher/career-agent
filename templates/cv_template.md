# ATS Optimization Guidelines

1. **Keywords**: Include exact job description keywords naturally throughout
2. **Format**: Use standard section headers recognized by ATS systems
3. **Bullets**: Start with action verbs (Built, Led, Designed, Implemented)
4. **Metrics**: Quantify achievements with numbers, percentages, scale
5. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent date formats (MM/YYYY)
6. **Simplicity**: Avoid tables, columns, headers/footers, graphics
7. **File Format**: Save as .txt or .docx for ATS parsing

# Markdown Features for Visual Appeal

- Use `**bold**` for emphasis on key terms
- Use `###` headers for clear section hierarchy  
- Use `>` blockquotes for summaries or highlights
- Use `-` bullets for clean list formatting
- Use `*italics*` for dates and locations
- Use `---` horizontal rules to separate major sections
