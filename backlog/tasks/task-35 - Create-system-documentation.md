## Description

Write comprehensive documentation including architecture overview following the document's design, setup instructions, usage guide, and API documentation. The docs/design.md should contain the architectural blueprint, README.md should provide quick start guide, and additional docs cover each component. Documentation follows PocketFlow's 'Agentic Coding' philosophy enabling both human developers and AI assistants to understand and extend the system.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] docs/design.md created with full architecture overview
- [ ] README.md with setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Disambiguation note about correct PocketFlow framework
- [ ] Installation steps with dependency requirements
- [ ] Usage examples showing typical workflow
- [ ] API documentation for all nodes and flows
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Development guide for extending the agent
- [ ] Documentation quality tests and validation
- [ ] Tests verify all code examples in documentation work correctly
- [ ] Tests ensure installation instructions are accurate
- [ ] Tests validate API documentation matches actual interfaces
- [ ] Tests verify troubleshooting guide addresses common issues
- [ ] Documentation completeness tests for all components
