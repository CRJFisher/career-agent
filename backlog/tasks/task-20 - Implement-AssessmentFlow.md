## Description

Create a workflow containing the SuitabilityScoringNode that generates the complete suitability assessment. This is a simple single-node flow but crucial for the overall pipeline. The AssessmentFlow takes the outputs from AnalysisFlow (requirement mappings and gaps) and CompanyResearchAgent (company insights) to produce a quantitative and qualitative assessment that guides narrative strategy and material generation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AssessmentFlow class created in flow.py inheriting from Flow
- [x] Single SuitabilityScoringNode instantiated in flow
- [x] Flow graph: start -> SuitabilityScoringNode -> end
- [x] Inputs from requirement_mapping_final and gaps processed
- [x] Company research data incorporated for cultural fit
- [x] Suitability assessment saved to shared['suitability_assessment']
- [x] Error handling for scoring failures implemented
- [x] Assessment data structure properly validated
- [x] Unit tests for flow initialization and node setup
- [x] Integration tests for complete assessment flow execution
- [x] Tests verify proper input data processing from previous flows
- [x] Tests validate assessment output structure and content
- [x] Error handling tests for missing or invalid inputs
- [x] Tests ensure proper shared store state management

## Implementation Plan

1. Create AssessmentFlow class in flow.py
2. Initialize with SuitabilityScoringNode instance
3. Define simple linear flow graph
4. Ensure all required inputs are available
5. Implement run() method for execution
6. Validate assessment output structure
7. Handle edge cases and errors
8. Return completed assessment state

## Implementation Notes & Findings

### Flow Architecture

AssessmentFlow is intentionally simple - a single-node flow that wraps SuitabilityScoringNode. This design choice was made because:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The flow handles orchestration and validation, while the node handles assessment logic
2. **Reusability**: The node can be used in other flows if needed
3. **Testability**: Easier to test flow logic separately from assessment logic

### Input Validation Strategy

The `prep()` method implements defensive programming:

1. **Required Fields Check**: Validates presence of all required inputs
2. **Graceful Defaults**: Initializes missing fields with sensible defaults rather than failing
3. **Logging**: Warns about missing fields to aid debugging
4. **Company Research**: Treated as optional but logs warning if missing

### Output Processing

The `post()` method provides:

1. **Structured Logging**: Creates a formatted summary of the assessment
2. **Visual Separation**: Uses divider lines to make logs easily scannable
3. **Truncation**: Long recommendation text is truncated in logs to avoid clutter

### Integration Points

Expected inputs from previous flows:
- `requirement_mapping_final` - From AnalysisFlow via GapAnalysisNode
- `gaps` - From AnalysisFlow via GapAnalysisNode  
- `company_research` - From CompanyResearchAgent
- `requirements` - From RequirementExtractionFlow
- `job_title` and `company_name` - From initial user input

### Testing Approach

1. **Flow Initialization**: Verify correct node setup
2. **Input Handling**: Test with complete, partial, and empty inputs
3. **Integration**: Mock the LLM to test full flow execution
4. **Logging**: Verify output format and content

### Key Learning

The PocketFlow orchestration handles most of the flow execution logic. We only needed to override `prep()` and `post()` for validation and logging. The framework's `_run()` method handles the node execution automatically.

### Future Enhancements

1. Could add a checkpoint save after assessment for user review
2. Could implement assessment caching to avoid re-running expensive LLM calls
3. Could add more sophisticated input validation based on data quality
