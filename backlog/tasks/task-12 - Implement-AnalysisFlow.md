## Description

**UPDATED**: Now includes checkpoint functionality for user review.

Create a workflow that chains RequirementMappingNode, StrengthAssessmentNode, and GapAnalysisNode in sequence for complete requirement analysis, followed by SaveCheckpointNode for user review. This enhanced workflow allows users to review and edit the analysis before proceeding. The flow executes three analytical steps then pauses, saving results to an editable YAML file.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AnalysisFlow class created in flow.py
- [ ] Four nodes connected: Mapping -> Assessment -> Gap -> SaveCheckpoint
- [ ] SaveCheckpointNode saves analysis_output.yaml for user review
- [ ] Output file includes clear sections and editing instructions
- [ ] Flow pauses after saving checkpoint
- [ ] LoadCheckpointNode available for resuming workflow
- [ ] Each node output feeds next node via shared store
- [ ] Complete analysis results preserved in checkpoint
- [ ] Error handling for node failures
- [ ] Flow maintains data integrity throughout pipeline
- [ ] Unit tests created for all public methods
- [ ] Test coverage of at least 80%
- [ ] Tests for checkpoint save/load functionality
- [ ] Tests for user edit detection and merging

## Implementation Plan

1. Create AnalysisFlow class inheriting from Flow
2. Initialize four nodes including SaveCheckpointNode
3. Define flow graph with sequential connections
4. Configure SaveCheckpointNode to export analysis results
5. Map action strings: each node returns 'continue'
6. Implement pause mechanism after checkpoint save
7. Add support for LoadCheckpointNode on resume
8. Ensure data integrity through save/load cycle
9. Add user notification for review step

## Dependencies
- SaveCheckpointNode (task-42)
- LoadCheckpointNode (task-43)
