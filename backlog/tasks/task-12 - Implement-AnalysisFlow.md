## Description

Create a workflow that chains RequirementMappingNode, StrengthAssessmentNode, and GapAnalysisNode in sequence for complete requirement analysis. This linear multi-step process is a canonical use case for PocketFlow Workflow pattern. The flow executes three distinct analytical steps: mapping requirements to experiences, assessing mapping strength, and identifying/mitigating gaps. Output serves as foundation for suitability assessment.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AnalysisFlow class created in flow.py
- [ ] Three nodes instantiated and connected in sequence
- [ ] Flow graph: start -> RequirementMapping -> StrengthAssessment -> GapAnalysis -> end
- [ ] Each node output feeds next node via shared store
- [ ] Proper action string handling between nodes
- [ ] Complete analysis results in requirement_mapping_final and gaps
- [ ] Error handling for node failures
- [ ] Flow maintains data integrity throughout pipeline

## Implementation Plan

1. Create AnalysisFlow class inheriting from Flow\n2. Initialize three nodes in constructor\n3. Define flow graph with sequential connections\n4. Map action strings: each node returns 'continue' except last\n5. Implement run() method for flow execution\n6. Ensure data passes correctly between nodes\n7. Add error handling and logging\n8. Return final state with complete analysis
