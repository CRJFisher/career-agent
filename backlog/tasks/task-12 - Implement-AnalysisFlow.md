## Description

Create a workflow that chains RequirementMappingNode, StrengthAssessmentNode, and GapAnalysisNode in sequence for complete requirement analysis. This linear multi-step process is a canonical use case for PocketFlow Workflow pattern. The flow executes three distinct analytical steps: mapping requirements to experiences, assessing mapping strength, and identifying/mitigating gaps. Output serves as foundation for suitability assessment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AnalysisFlow class created in flow.py
- [ ] Three nodes instantiated and connected in sequence
- [ ] Flow graph: start -> RequirementMapping -> StrengthAssessment -> GapAnalysis -> end
- [ ] Each node output feeds next node via shared store
- [ ] Proper action string handling between nodes
- [ ] Complete analysis results in requirement_mapping_final and gaps
- [ ] Error handling for node failures
- [ ] Flow maintains data integrity throughout pipeline
- [ ] Unit tests created for all public methods
- [ ] Test coverage of at least 80%
- [ ] Integration tests with multiple nodes working together
- [ ] Mock-based testing for external dependencies (node dependencies)
- [ ] Error cases tested (node failures, data corruption, invalid states)
- [ ] End-to-end flow testing with realistic data

## Implementation Plan

1. Create AnalysisFlow class inheriting from Flow
2. Initialize three nodes in constructor
3. Define flow graph with sequential connections
4. Map action strings: each node returns 'continue' except last
5. Implement run() method for flow execution
6. Ensure data passes correctly between nodes
7. Add error handling and logging
8. Return final state with complete analysis
