## Description

**UPDATED**: Now includes checkpoint functionality for user review.

Create a workflow that chains RequirementMappingNode, StrengthAssessmentNode, and GapAnalysisNode in sequence for complete requirement analysis, followed by SaveCheckpointNode for user review. This enhanced workflow allows users to review and edit the analysis before proceeding. The flow executes three analytical steps then pauses, saving results to an editable YAML file.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AnalysisFlow class created in flow.py
- [x] Four nodes connected: Mapping -> Assessment -> Gap -> SaveCheckpoint
- [x] SaveCheckpointNode saves analysis_output.yaml for user review
- [x] Output file includes clear sections and editing instructions
- [x] Flow pauses after saving checkpoint
- [x] LoadCheckpointNode available for resuming workflow
- [x] Each node output feeds next node via shared store
- [x] Complete analysis results preserved in checkpoint
- [x] Error handling for node failures
- [x] Flow maintains data integrity throughout pipeline
- [x] Unit tests created for all public methods
- [x] Test coverage of at least 80%
- [x] Tests for checkpoint save/load functionality
- [ ] Tests for user edit detection and merging

## Implementation Plan

1. Create AnalysisFlow class inheriting from Flow
2. Initialize four nodes including SaveCheckpointNode
3. Define flow graph with sequential connections
4. Configure SaveCheckpointNode to export analysis results
5. Map action strings: each node returns 'continue'
6. Implement pause mechanism after checkpoint save
7. Add support for LoadCheckpointNode on resume
8. Ensure data integrity through save/load cycle
9. Add user notification for review step

## Dependencies

- SaveCheckpointNode (task-42) - Already implemented
- LoadCheckpointNode (task-43) - Already implemented

## Completion Summary

**Completed on**: 2025-08-01

### Implementation Details

- Updated AnalysisFlow to connect all four analysis nodes in proper sequence
- RequirementMappingNode → StrengthAssessmentNode → GapAnalysisNode → SaveCheckpointNode
- Configured checkpoint to save all relevant analysis data:
  - requirements, requirement_mapping_raw, requirement_mapping_assessed
  - requirement_mapping_final, gaps, coverage_score
- Flow uses PocketFlow's >> operator for clean node connections
- Checkpoint configuration ensures all analysis results are preserved

### Key Features

1. **Complete Pipeline**: All analysis nodes connected in logical sequence
2. **Data Flow**: Each node's output feeds the next via shared store
3. **Checkpoint Integration**: Saves comprehensive analysis for user review
4. **Pause/Resume**: Flow pauses after checkpoint for manual review

### Test Coverage

- Created comprehensive test suite with 10 tests
- All tests passing with proper mocking of LLM dependencies
- Tests cover initialization, node connections, checkpoint configuration
- Validates data flow and error handling

### Notes

- SaveCheckpointNode and LoadCheckpointNode were already implemented
- Flow supports the pause/resume workflow pattern for user edits
- Checkpoint includes all data needed for narrative generation
- User edit detection and merging tests deferred to checkpoint node tests
