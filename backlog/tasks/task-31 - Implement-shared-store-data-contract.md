## Description

Define and document the complete data contract for the shared store including all keys, data types, and flow dependencies. The shared store is the central nervous system enabling communication between all phases. This contract defines the API between components, ensuring modularity and debuggability. Document includes comprehensive table mapping each key to its producer and consumer flows, serving as the single source of truth for data dependencies.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete data contract documentation created
- [ ] Table with Key/Data Type/Produced By/Consumed By columns
- [ ] All 10 primary keys documented (career_db through cover_letter_text)
- [ ] Data types specified (dict/str/list) for each key
- [ ] Producer flow identified for each data element
- [ ] Consumer flows mapped showing dependencies
- [ ] Contract enforced through validation logic
- [ ] Documentation integrated into codebase
- [ ] Validation tests for data contract compliance
- [ ] Tests verify all documented keys are properly defined
- [ ] Tests validate data type consistency across flows
- [ ] Tests ensure producer-consumer relationships work correctly
- [ ] Contract validation helper function tests
- [ ] Tests verify shared store initialization includes all required keys

## Implementation Plan

1. Create data contract documentation file\n2. Define table structure with four columns\n3. Document career_db: dict from Initial Setup\n4. Document job_spec_text through cover_letter_text\n5. Map producer flows for each key\n6. Map consumer flows showing usage\n7. Add validation helper functions\n8. Include contract in design documentation
