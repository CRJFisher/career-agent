## Description

**UPDATED**: This task is now part of the AI-driven browser approach. Instead of a standalone search utility, this will be integrated with the browser automation tools.

Implement utils/web_search.py module that provides web search functionality through AI-driven browser automation. This utility will work in conjunction with the BrowserActionNode to perform intelligent web searches, navigate results, and extract information. The implementation should support Google search through headless browser automation rather than API calls, enabling more sophisticated interaction with search results.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] utils/web_search.py created with browser-based search
- [ ] Integration with Playwright/Puppeteer for browser automation
- [ ] search(query: str, browser) function performs Google search
- [ ] Handles dynamic content and JavaScript rendering
- [ ] Extracts organic results with URL, title, snippet
- [ ] Filters out ads and sponsored content
- [ ] Supports pagination through results
- [ ] AI-driven result relevance scoring
- [ ] Error handling for page load failures
- [ ] Screenshot capability for debugging
- [ ] Unit tests with mocked browser interactions
- [ ] Test coverage of at least 80%
- [ ] Tests for JavaScript-heavy pages
- [ ] Tests for various Google result formats
