## Description

**UPDATED**: This task is now part of the AI-driven browser approach. Instead of a standalone search utility, this will be integrated with the browser automation tools.

Implement utils/web_search.py module that provides web search functionality through AI-driven browser automation. This utility will work in conjunction with the BrowserActionNode to perform intelligent web searches, navigate results, and extract information. The implementation should support Google search through headless browser automation rather than API calls, enabling more sophisticated interaction with search results.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] utils/web_search.py created with browser-based search
- [x] Integration with Playwright/Puppeteer for browser automation
- [x] search(query: str, browser) function performs Google search
- [x] Handles dynamic content and JavaScript rendering
- [x] Extracts organic results with URL, title, snippet
- [x] Filters out ads and sponsored content
- [x] Supports pagination through results
- [x] AI-driven result relevance scoring
- [x] Error handling for page load failures
- [x] Screenshot capability for debugging
- [x] Unit tests with mocked browser interactions
- [x] Test coverage of at least 80%
- [x] Tests for JavaScript-heavy pages
- [x] Tests for various Google result formats

## Implementation Plan

1. Create utils/web_search.py module
2. Set up Playwright browser automation
3. Implement Google search navigation
4. Add result extraction with CSS/XPath selectors
5. Implement AI-based relevance scoring
6. Add pagination support
7. Handle dynamic content loading
8. Add screenshot and debugging features
9. Create comprehensive test suite

## Dependencies

- Playwright or Puppeteer for browser automation
- BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- LLM wrapper for relevance scoring

## Completion Summary

**Completed on**: 2025-08-01

### Implementation Details

- Implemented WebSearcher class with Playwright browser automation
- Async/await pattern throughout for efficient browser operations
- Google search with CSS selector-based result extraction
- SearchResult class encapsulates individual results
- AI-driven relevance scoring using batch LLM prompts
- Pagination support with configurable results per page
- Automatic filtering of ads and sponsored content
- Context manager support for proper browser cleanup

### Key Features

1. **Browser Automation**: Uses Playwright with headless Chrome
2. **Smart Extraction**: Handles various Google result formats
3. **Relevance Scoring**: LLM scores results from 0.0 to 1.0
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of timeouts and errors
5. **Debug Support**: Screenshots on errors for troubleshooting
6. **Sync Wrappers**: Convenience functions for non-async usage

### Test Coverage

- Created comprehensive test suite with 12 passing tests
- All async operations properly mocked
- Tests cover search, pagination, error handling, and scoring
- Integration test included but marked for manual execution

### Notes

- Requires `playwright install` after pip install playwright
- Uses OpenRouter LLM for relevance scoring
- Rate limiting handled with small delays between pages
- Screenshots saved as debug_*.png for troubleshooting
