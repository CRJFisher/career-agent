## Description

Create professional templates and formatting guidelines for the generated CV and cover letter documents. The CV uses GitHub-flavored Markdown for rich formatting including headers, lists, bold/italic text, and links. The cover letter uses plain text with clear paragraph structure. Both templates must be ATS-friendly while maintaining visual appeal. Templates guide the generation nodes to produce consistent, professional output.
