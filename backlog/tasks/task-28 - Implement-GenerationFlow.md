## Description

Create a workflow containing CVGenerationNode and CoverLetterNode to produce final application materials. This is the final generative phase that transforms all strategic decisions into tangible deliverables. The workflow can run both nodes in parallel since they draw from the same inputs (narrative strategy, assessment, research) but produce independent outputs. This represents the culmination of the entire agent pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GenerationFlow class created in flow.py inheriting from Flow
- [ ] CVGenerationNode and CoverLetterNode instantiated
- [ ] Nodes can run in parallel for efficiency
- [ ] Both nodes access narrative_strategy assessment and research
- [ ] CV generated as Markdown in shared['cv_markdown']
- [ ] Cover letter as text in shared['cover_letter_text']
- [ ] Error handling for generation failures
- [ ] Validates both outputs before completion
- [ ] Unit tests for flow initialization and node setup
- [ ] Integration tests for complete generation flow execution
- [ ] Tests verify parallel execution of generation nodes (if implemented)
- [ ] Tests validate proper access to all required input data
- [ ] Tests ensure both CV and cover letter are generated successfully
- [ ] Error handling tests for individual node failures
- [ ] Output validation tests for final material quality

## Implementation Plan

1. Create GenerationFlow class inheriting from Flow
2. Initialize both generation nodes
3. Design parallel execution graph if possible
4. Ensure all inputs available to both nodes
5. Implement run() method for execution
6. Handle generation errors gracefully
7. Validate output formats
8. Return completed materials
