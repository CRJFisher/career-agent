## Description

Create a workflow containing CVGenerationNode and CoverLetterNode to produce final application materials. This is the final generative phase that transforms all strategic decisions into tangible deliverables. The workflow can run both nodes in parallel since they draw from the same inputs (narrative strategy, assessment, research) but produce independent outputs. This represents the culmination of the entire agent pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] GenerationFlow class created in flow.py inheriting from Flow
- [x] CVGenerationNode and CoverLetterNode instantiated
- [x] Nodes can run in parallel for efficiency
- [x] Both nodes access narrative_strategy assessment and research
- [x] CV generated as Markdown in shared['cv_markdown']
- [x] Cover letter as text in shared['cover_letter_text']
- [x] Error handling for generation failures
- [x] Validates both outputs before completion
- [x] Unit tests for flow initialization and node setup
- [x] Integration tests for complete generation flow execution
- [x] Tests verify parallel execution of generation nodes (if implemented)
- [x] Tests validate proper access to all required input data
- [x] Tests ensure both CV and cover letter are generated successfully
- [x] Error handling tests for individual node failures
- [x] Output validation tests for final material quality

## Implementation Plan

1. Create GenerationFlow class inheriting from Flow
2. Initialize both generation nodes
3. Design parallel execution graph if possible
4. Ensure all inputs available to both nodes
5. Implement run() method for execution
6. Handle generation errors gracefully
7. Validate output formats
8. Return completed materials

## Implementation Notes & Findings

### Flow Architecture

Successfully implemented GenerationFlow using PocketFlow's BatchFlow for parallel execution:
- Inherits from BatchFlow to enable parallel node execution
- Starts with LoadCheckpointNode to load narrative strategy from checkpoint
- CVGenerationNode and CoverLetterNode run in parallel after loading
- Both nodes share the same inputs but produce independent outputs

### Key Design Decisions

1. **BatchFlow Usage**: Used BatchFlow instead of Flow for efficient parallel execution
2. **Checkpoint Loading**: Starts with LoadCheckpointNode to ensure narrative data available
3. **Parallel Connections**: Both generation nodes connected to load node (load >> cv, load >> cover)
4. **Output Validation**: Post method validates both outputs before saving files
5. **File Saving**: Automatic file saving with timestamp and sanitized names

### Implementation Features

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Validates required fields (narrative_strategy, career_db) 
   - Adds default suitability assessment if missing
   - Warns about missing company research

2. **Output Management**:
   - CV saved as Markdown file
   - Cover letter saved as text file
   - Files named with timestamp, company, and job title
   - Outputs directory created automatically

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Handles individual node failures gracefully
   - Only saves files if both outputs generated successfully
   - Logs detailed status for each generation

### Testing Strategy

Created 20 comprehensive tests covering:
- Flow initialization and BatchFlow inheritance
- Input validation (required vs optional fields)
- Output validation and file saving
- Error scenarios (partial failures)
- Logging and metrics
- File naming with special characters

### Integration Points

GenerationFlow integrates with:
- **LoadCheckpointNode**: Loads narrative checkpoint data
- **CVGenerationNode**: Generates tailored CV in Markdown
- **CoverLetterNode**: Generates 5-part cover letter
- **File System**: Saves outputs to timestamped files

### Parallel Execution Design

The parallel execution pattern:
1. LoadCheckpointNode runs first, loading all narrative data
2. Both CVGenerationNode and CoverLetterNode receive "checkpoint_loaded" action
3. PocketFlow's BatchFlow executes both generation nodes simultaneously
4. Results collected and validated in post() method

### Output File Structure

Files saved as:
```
outputs/
├── 20240115_120000_InnovateTech_Senior_Platform_Engineer_CV.md
└── 20240115_120000_InnovateTech_Senior_Platform_Engineer_CoverLetter.txt
```

### Future Enhancements

1. **Progress Tracking**: Add progress callbacks for long-running generation
2. **Format Options**: Support different output formats (PDF, DOCX)
3. **Template Selection**: Allow users to choose CV/letter templates
4. **Preview Mode**: Generate preview without saving files
5. **Batch Processing**: Support multiple job applications in one run
