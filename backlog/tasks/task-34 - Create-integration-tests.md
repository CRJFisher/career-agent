## Description

Develop comprehensive integration tests that validate the entire job application agent pipeline from input to output. Tests should cover the complete flow from career database loading through material generation. Include mock data for career database, sample job descriptions, and validate that each phase produces expected outputs. This ensures system reliability and catches integration issues between components.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integration test suite created with pytest or unittest
- [ ] End-to-end test covering full pipeline execution
- [ ] Mock career database YAML file created
- [ ] Sample job descriptions for different roles
- [ ] Validates requirement extraction produces structured YAML
- [ ] Validates mapping and gap analysis completion
- [ ] Validates company research agent behavior
- [ ] Checks final CV and cover letter generation
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covering all integration points
- [ ] Tests verify data persistence across flow boundaries
- [ ] Tests validate error propagation and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Performance tests for complete pipeline execution
- [ ] Tests ensure mock data compatibility with real system
- [ ] Tests verify output quality and format consistency
- [ ] Regression tests to prevent future integration breakages

## Implementation Plan

1. Create tests/test_integration.py file\n2. Design mock career database with sample data\n3. Create test job descriptions\n4. Implement test_full_pipeline() function\n5. Validate each phase's output structure\n6. Check data flow between phases\n7. Verify final materials generated\n8. Add edge case testing
