## Description

The design document mentions "LLM response caching in development" as a performance optimization, but this hasn't been implemented. Caching LLM responses would significantly reduce costs and improve performance during development and testing, especially when rerunning the same prompts multiple times.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Design caching strategy (memory vs disk, TTL, cache keys)
- [ ] Implement caching layer in utils/llm_wrapper.py
- [ ] Support different cache backends:
  - In-memory cache for development
  - Disk-based cache for persistence
  - Optional Redis support for production
- [ ] Cache key should include:
  - Model name
  - Prompt hash
  - Temperature and other parameters
- [ ] Add cache hit/miss metrics
- [ ] Provide cache control options (bypass, clear, TTL)
- [ ] Create tests for caching functionality
- [ ] Document caching configuration

## Implementation Plan

1. Add caching dependencies (e.g., diskcache library)
2. Modify LLMWrapper class to support caching
3. Implement cache key generation
4. Add cache storage and retrieval logic
5. Add configuration options for enabling/disabling cache
6. Implement cache management commands (clear, stats)
7. Add comprehensive tests
8. Update documentation

## Notes

Benefits:
- Faster development iterations
- Reduced API costs during testing
- Deterministic behavior for cached responses
- Ability to work offline with cached responses
