## Description

As mentioned in the PROJECT_COMPLETION_SUMMARY, a web interface would make the system more accessible to non-technical users. This would provide a user-friendly alternative to the CLI interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Design web UI mockups for key workflows
- [x] Choose web framework (FastAPI, Flask, or Django)
- [x] Implement core pages:
  - Dashboard with recent applications
  - Career database management
  - Job application wizard
  - Document preview/editing
  - Progress tracking
- [x] Add real-time updates for long-running processes
- [x] Implement file upload for documents
- [x] Create YAML editor with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add authentication and user management (deferred to future)
- [x] Deploy with Docker container
- [x] Create user documentation

## Implementation Plan

1. Research and choose web framework
2. Design UI/UX mockups
3. Set up project structure
4. Create API endpoints for existing functionality
5. Implement frontend with modern framework (React/Vue)
6. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
7. Implement file handling
8. Add authentication layer
9. Create deployment configuration
10. Write user guide

## Notes

Key features:
- Visual workflow builder
- Drag-and-drop document upload
- Side-by-side document comparison
- Interactive checkpoint editing
- Application history and analytics
- Template library for CVs and cover letters

## Implementation Details

### Framework Selection

After evaluation, **FastAPI** was chosen for the backend due to:
- Async-first design perfect for long-running LLM operations
- Built-in WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Automatic API documentation
- Excellent performance
- Modern Python features

Frontend uses **React with TypeScript** and Material-UI for a professional, responsive interface.

```

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Dashboard**
   - Real-time statistics
   - Recent workflow activity
   - Quick action buttons
   - Database status overview

2. **Career Database Management**
   - Build from directory path
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - View/edit experiences
   - YAML editor with syntax highlighting
   - Export functionality

3. **Job Analysis**
   - URL-based job analysis
   - Visual fit scoring (technical, cultural, overall)
   - Key strengths and gaps display
   - Direct document generation links

4. **Document Generation**
   - CV and cover letter generation
   - Multiple templates and tones
   - Real-time preview
   - Download capabilities

5. **Workflow History**
   - Comprehensive workflow tracking
   - Status filtering
   - Search functionality
   - Progress indicators

### Technical Implementation

1. **Backend (FastAPI)**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Background task processing
   - File upload handling
   - CORS configuration

2. **Frontend (React/TypeScript)**
   - Material-UI components
   - React Query for data fetching
   - Redux for state management
   - WebSocket client for live updates
   - Responsive design

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket connections per workflow
   - Progress tracking
   - Status updates
   - Error handling

4. **Deployment**
   - Docker containers for both frontend and backend
   - Docker Compose for local development
   - Nginx reverse proxy
   - Environment-based configuration

### Security Considerations

- Input validation with Pydantic
- File type validation for uploads
- CORS properly configured
- Error handling without exposing internals
- Authentication framework ready (not implemented)

### Future Enhancements

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - User registration/login
   - JWT token management
   - Role-based access control

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Batch operations
   - Advanced search
   - Email notifications
   - Mobile app

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Dark mode
   - Customizable themes
   - Drag-and-drop workflow builder
   - More visualizations
