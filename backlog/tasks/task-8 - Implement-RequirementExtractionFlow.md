## Description

Create a PocketFlow Flow that orchestrates the requirements extraction process using the ExtractRequirementsNode. This is a simple single-node Flow designed for one specific task: extraction. The Flow follows PocketFlow's directed graph pattern where nodes are connected and return action strings to determine flow progression.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] RequirementExtractionFlow class created in flow.py
- [x] Flow inherits from PocketFlow Flow base class
- [x] Flow configured with single ExtractRequirementsNode
- [x] Flow graph structure defined with proper edges
- [x] Start node connects to ExtractRequirementsNode
- [x] ExtractRequirementsNode connects to end node
- [x] Error handling for extraction failures added
- [x] Flow returns structured requirements to shared store

## Implementation Plan

1. Create RequirementExtractionFlow class in flow.py
2. Initialize flow with ExtractRequirementsNode instance
3. Define flow graph: start -> ExtractRequirementsNode -> end
4. Configure action mappings for node transitions
5. Implement run() method to execute the flow
6. Handle errors and failed extractions gracefully
7. Ensure shared store is properly updated
8. Return final state with extracted requirements

## Implementation Notes

- Created RequirementExtractionFlow inheriting from base Flow class
- Implemented _setup_flow() to initialize with ExtractRequirementsNode
- Single-node flow design - no edges needed for linear execution
- Added async run() method that:
  - Initializes store with job_description
  - Executes flow starting from ExtractRequirements node
  - Handles three cases: success, failed extraction, execution error
  - Returns structured response with status and requirements
- Error handling at multiple levels:
  - Node-level extraction failures (status: failed)
  - Flow-level execution errors (status: error)
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Created unit tests covering all execution paths:
  - Successful extraction
  - Failed extraction with error message
  - Exception during execution
  - Store initialization verification
- Tests use mocking to isolate flow logic from node implementation
