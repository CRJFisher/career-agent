## Description

The design document mentions "AI-driven browser tools" and "BrowserActionNode" for advanced web interactions. Before implementing from scratch, we should thoroughly research existing AI-powered web scraping tools and libraries that could meet our needs. Only if none are suitable should we build custom functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Research (Required) ✅

- [x] Research existing AI-powered web scraping tools:
  - [x] Evaluate LangChain's browser tools and WebBaseLoader
  - [x] Research Playwright with AI capabilities (e.g., playwright-ai)
  - [x] Investigate Selenium with AI extensions
  - [x] Evaluate commercial APIs (Browserless, ScrapingBee, Apify)
  - [x] Research open-source projects (Crawlee, Puppeteer-extra, AutoScraper)
  - [x] Investigate GPT-powered scrapers (ScrapeGraphAI, Firecrawl)
- [x] Create evaluation matrix comparing:
  - Features (form filling, navigation, dynamic content)
  - AI integration capabilities
  - Cost and licensing
  - Maintenance and community support
  - Integration complexity with our PocketFlow architecture
- [x] Document findings and recommendations

### Phase 2: Integration (If suitable tool found) ✅

- [x] Integrate chosen tool into utils/
- [x] Create wrapper to match our Node interface
- [x] Implement BrowserActionNode using the tool
- [x] Add tests and documentation
- [x] Update DecideActionNode to support browser actions

### Phase 3: Custom Implementation (Only if needed)

- [ ] Justify why existing tools don't meet requirements
- [ ] Design custom solution using Playwright/Puppeteer
- [ ] Implement AI-driven action selection
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests
- [ ] Document the custom implementation

## Research Focus Areas

1. **LangChain Browser Tools**
   - Does it support our use cases?
   - How well does it integrate with our LLM wrapper?
   - What are the limitations?

2. **ScrapeGraphAI**
   - Open-source library using LLMs for scraping
   - Natural language queries to extract data
   - Multiple LLM support

3. **Firecrawl**
   - Converts websites to LLM-ready data
   - Handles dynamic content
   - API-based approach

4. **Playwright-AI/Puppeteer-extra**
   - AI plugins for existing browser automation
   - Stealth capabilities
   - Community plugins

5. **Commercial Solutions**
   - Browserless.io (headless browser API)
   - ScrapingBee (AI-powered scraping)
   - Apify (actor-based scraping platform)

## Implementation Plan

1. **Research Phase** (1-2 days)
   - Evaluate each tool against our requirements
   - Create proof-of-concept integrations
   - Compare performance and capabilities

2. **Decision Phase**
   - Choose best approach based on research
   - Get approval if commercial tool is recommended
   - Plan integration strategy

3. **Integration Phase**
   - Implement chosen solution
   - Create BrowserActionNode wrapper
   - Add to DecideActionNode's action space
   - Write tests and documentation

## Notes

This is an advanced feature that would significantly enhance the research agent's capabilities, especially for:

- Accessing content behind login walls
- Interacting with job application portals
- Extracting data from interactive dashboards
- Navigating complex company websites

## Evaluation Criteria

### Must-Have Requirements

1. **Dynamic Content Handling**: JavaScript-rendered pages
2. **Form Interaction**: Fill and submit forms programmatically
3. **Navigation**: Click links, buttons, navigate between pages
4. **Data Extraction**: Extract structured data from complex layouts
5. **LLM Integration**: Work with our existing LLM wrapper
6. **Python Support**: Native Python or good Python bindings

### Nice-to-Have Features

1. **Stealth Mode**: Avoid bot detection
2. **Session Management**: Handle cookies and authentication
3. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple browser instances
4. **Visual Debugging**: Screenshots, videos of interactions
5. **Natural Language Commands**: "Click the Apply button"
6. **Automatic Retry**: Handle transient failures

### Integration Requirements

1. **PocketFlow Compatible**: Easy to wrap in Node interface
2. **Async Support**: Work with our async infrastructure
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes
4. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of browser instances
5. **Testing**: Mockable for unit tests

## Use Cases to Evaluate

1. **Job Portal Navigation**
   - Navigate to job listings
   - Click "Apply" buttons
   - Fill application forms
   - Handle multi-step applications

2. **Company Research**
   - Extract data from About pages
   - Navigate complex site structures
   - Handle infinite scroll
   - Extract from modal dialogs

3. **Dynamic Content**
   - Wait for AJAX content
   - Handle SPAs (Single Page Apps)
   - Extract from charts/graphs
   - Interact with dropdowns

## Research Output

Create a research document (`docs/ai_browser_tools_evaluation.md`) with:

1. **Tool Comparison Matrix**
   - Feature checklist for each tool
   - Pros and cons
   - Code examples
   - Integration complexity

2. **Proof of Concept**
   - Simple example with top 2-3 candidates
   - Performance metrics
   - Error handling demonstration

3. **Recommendation**
   - Recommended approach with justification
   - Implementation timeline
   - Cost analysis (if commercial)
   - Risk assessment

## Decision Criteria

The research-first approach ensures we:

- Don't reinvent the wheel
- Choose the most maintainable solution
- Leverage existing community efforts
- Make an informed decision based on actual evaluation
- Consider total cost of ownership (TCO)

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Research Completed

Created comprehensive research document: `docs/ai_browser_tools_evaluation.md`

Key findings:

- Evaluated 6 major AI browser tools
- LangChain Browser Tools selected as the best fit
- Provides good balance of features, flexibility, and maintenance
- Compatible with our existing LLM wrapper pattern

### Phase 2: Integration Completed

1. **Created AI Browser Module** (`utils/ai_browser.py`)
   - `AIBrowser` class wrapping LangChain's PlayWrightBrowserToolkit
   - Custom tools for job application workflows
   - `AISimpleScraper` for lightweight extraction tasks
   - Async support throughout

2. **Implemented BrowserActionNode** (added to `nodes.py`)
   - Supports 4 action types:
     - `extract_jobs`: Extract job listings from job boards
     - `fill_application`: Fill and optionally submit job forms
     - `navigate_and_extract`: Extract data from dynamic pages
     - `simple_extract`: Lightweight extraction for static content
   - Full async support with proper resource management
   - Error handling and structured responses

3. **Updated DecideActionNode**
   - Added `browser_action` to available actions
   - Updated prompt to include browser action documentation
   - Added proper state management for browser actions

4. **Created Comprehensive Tests** (`tests/test_browser_action_node.py`)
   - Unit tests for all action types
   - Error handling tests
   - Resource cleanup tests
   - Mock-based testing to avoid external dependencies

5. **Wrote Documentation** (`docs/ai_browser_integration.md`)
   - Architecture overview
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples for all action types
   - Best practices and troubleshooting
   - API reference

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Hybrid Approach**: Combined LangChain tools with custom extensions
2. **Async-First**: All browser operations are async for better performance
3. **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup with context managers
4. **Flexibility**: Support for both heavy browser automation and lightweight scraping
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing PocketFlow nodes

### Performance Considerations

- Browser instance kept alive during node execution
- Lightweight scraper option for simple extractions
- Proper error handling to prevent resource leaks
- Configurable timeouts and retry mechanisms

### Security Measures

- URL validation before navigation
- No auto-submit without explicit configuration
- Respect for robots.txt and rate limiting
- Secure form data handling
