## Description

The design document mentions "AI-driven browser tools" and "BrowserActionNode" that would use Playwright/Puppeteer for headless browser automation with LangChain Browser Tools for AI-driven interactions. Currently, the system only has basic web scraping with BeautifulSoup. This advanced browser functionality would enable more complex web interactions like form filling, navigation, and dynamic content handling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Research and choose between Playwright and Puppeteer for browser automation
- [ ] Create utils/browser_tools.py with AI-driven browser capabilities
- [ ] Implement BrowserActionNode that can:
  - Navigate to pages
  - Click elements
  - Fill forms
  - Extract data from dynamic content
  - Handle JavaScript-rendered pages
- [ ] Integrate with DecideActionNode to support browser actions
- [ ] Add browser action to the ACTION SPACE in DecideActionNode
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for browser functionality
- [ ] Update documentation with browser capabilities

## Implementation Plan

1. Install Playwright or Puppeteer dependencies
2. Create browser utility wrapper class
3. Implement AI-driven action selection (using LLM to decide what to click/fill)
4. Create BrowserActionNode following PocketFlow patterns
5. Update DecideActionNode to include browser actions
6. Add integration tests with mock browser
7. Document usage and examples

## Notes

This is an advanced feature that would significantly enhance the research agent's capabilities, especially for:
- Accessing content behind login walls
- Interacting with job application portals
- Extracting data from interactive dashboards
- Navigating complex company websites
