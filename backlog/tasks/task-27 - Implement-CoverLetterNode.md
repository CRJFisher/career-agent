## Description

Create a node that generates a compelling cover letter following the user-specified 5-part structure: Hook, Value Proposition, Evidence, Company Fit, Call to Action. The node uses narrative strategy, company research, and suitability assessment to create a personalized, authentic letter. Each section has specific requirements - Hook addresses company need, Value Proposition states unique value, Evidence provides CAR stories, Company Fit shows research, Call to Action is confident and clear.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] CoverLetterNode class created following Node lifecycle
- [x] 5-part structure template strictly followed
- [x] Hook directly addresses company need/goal from research
- [x] Value proposition uses unique_value_proposition from assessment
- [x] Evidence section incorporates 2-3 CAR format stories
- [x] Company fit demonstrates deep research understanding
- [x] Call to action is confident and specific
- [x] Authentic personalized tone throughout letter
- [x] Unit tests for cover letter node lifecycle methods
- [x] Tests verify 5-part structure implementation
- [x] Tests validate proper use of company research data
- [x] Tests ensure unique value proposition integration
- [x] Tests verify CAR story incorporation in evidence section
- [x] Tests validate company fit demonstration accuracy
- [x] Output validation tests for cover letter completeness and tone

## Implementation Plan

1. Create CoverLetterNode class with Node interface
2. Design cover letter prompt with 5-part template
3. Map Hook to company mission/goal from research
4. Use unique_value_proposition for section 2
5. Include evidence_stories from narrative strategy
6. Reference company culture and values for fit
7. Create strong call to action conclusion
8. Output text to shared['cover_letter_text']

## Implementation Notes & Findings

### Node Architecture

Successfully implemented CoverLetterNode as an LLM-driven node that:
- Follows strict 5-part structure (Hook, Value Prop, Evidence, Company Fit, CTA)
- Integrates narrative strategy, company research, and suitability assessment
- Handles missing company research gracefully with generic fallback
- Validates structure and provides robust fallback generation

### 5-Part Structure Implementation

1. **HOOK (Opening Paragraph)**:
   - Starts with company's current need/goal from research
   - Connects to candidate's present role from career arc
   - Mentions specific job title and company
   - Incorporates first key message

2. **VALUE PROPOSITION (Second Paragraph)**:
   - States unique value proposition from suitability assessment
   - References first must-tell experience by name
   - Includes specific metrics from that experience
   - Connects value to company's needs

3. **EVIDENCE (Third Paragraph)**:
   - Uses CAR story from evidence_stories if available
   - Falls back to must-tell experience key points
   - Shows quantified impact
   - Mirrors job specification language

4. **COMPANY FIT (Fourth Paragraph)**:
   - References specific company culture aspect
   - Connects to future vision from career arc
   - Shows how differentiator aligns with values
   - Demonstrates research depth

5. **CALL TO ACTION (Closing Paragraph)**:
   - Reinforces all 3 key messages succinctly
   - Expresses enthusiasm for company by name
   - Confident interview request
   - Professional closing with name

### Prompt Design Features

The prompt includes:
- **Role Definition**: Expert cover letter writer
- **Complete Context**: All narrative, research, and assessment data
- **Structured Instructions**: Detailed requirements for each paragraph
- **Specific Content**: Exact phrases and elements to include
- **Tone Guidance**: Professional yet personable, confident without arrogance

### Error Handling & Validation

1. **Structure Validation**:
   - Checks for minimum 5 paragraphs
   - Verifies greeting and closing present
   - Triggers fallback if structure invalid

2. **Length Validation**:
   - Minimum 300 characters required
   - Short responses trigger fallback

3. **Missing Data Handling**:
   - Generic company research created if missing
   - Warnings logged but generation continues
   - Fallback handles empty narrative sections

### Fallback Strategy

Robust fallback cover letter ensures output even on LLM failure:
- Uses all narrative strategy components
- Follows 5-part structure
- Handles missing/empty data gracefully
- Safe indexing for arrays (key_messages, must_tells, etc.)

### Testing Coverage

Created 20 comprehensive tests covering:
- Input validation (narrative, assessment required)
- Company research handling (missing, generic)
- Prompt content verification
- 5-part structure validation
- Fallback generation scenarios
- Edge cases (empty sections, missing data)
- Output storage and logging

### Integration Points

The node integrates with:
- **NarrativeStrategyNode**: Uses all 5 narrative components
- **CompanyResearchAgent**: Incorporates mission, culture, importance
- **SuitabilityScoringNode**: Uses UVP and fit scores
- **Career Database**: Gets personal info (name) for closing

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Strict Structure Enforcement**: 5-part structure non-negotiable
2. **Context-Rich Prompt**: All relevant data provided to LLM
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Generic research better than failure
4. **Evidence Flexibility**: CAR stories or must-tell experiences
5. **Safe Array Access**: Prevents IndexError in fallback

### Prompt Engineering Insights

1. **Numbered Structure**: Clear 1-5 labeling improves compliance
2. **Specific Instructions**: Exact content for each paragraph
3. **Example Phrases**: Showing expected content in prompt
4. **Tone Examples**: "Professional yet personable" with examples

### Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple Versions**: Formal vs conversational tone options
2. **Length Variants**: Short (3 para) vs full (5 para) versions
3. **Industry Customization**: Tech vs finance vs healthcare styles
4. **A/B Testing**: Test different hooks and CTAs
5. **Company Voice Matching**: Analyze company content for tone
