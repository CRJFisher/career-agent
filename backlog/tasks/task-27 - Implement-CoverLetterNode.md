## Description

Create a node that generates a compelling cover letter following the user-specified 5-part structure: Hook, Value Proposition, Evidence, Company Fit, Call to Action. The node uses narrative strategy, company research, and suitability assessment to create a personalized, authentic letter. Each section has specific requirements - Hook addresses company need, Value Proposition states unique value, Evidence provides CAR stories, Company Fit shows research, Call to Action is confident and clear.
