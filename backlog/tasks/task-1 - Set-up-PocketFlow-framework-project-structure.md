## Description

Initialize the project with the correct PocketFlow framework structure including docs/design.md, utils/, nodes.py, flow.py, and main.py as recommended in the PocketFlow documentation. This follows the minimalist 100-line LLM orchestration framework philosophy of The-Pocket/PocketFlow (NOT Tencent/PocketFlow or Saoge123/PocketFlow). The framework models all LLM applications as a directed graph with three core concepts: Nodes (discrete units of work), Flow (directed graph connecting nodes), and Shared Store (common data repository).
## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Project directory structure created following PocketFlow conventions
- [x] Core files (nodes.py flow.py main.py) initialized with proper imports
- [x] utils/ directory created for external interactions
- [x] docs/ directory with design.md created
- [x] README.md with framework disambiguation note
- [x] Python project initialized with proper .gitignore

## Implementation Plan

1. Create project root directory structure\n2. Initialize Python project with pyproject.toml or setup.py\n3. Create core PocketFlow files: nodes.py, flow.py, main.py\n4. Create utils/ directory for utilities\n5. Create docs/ directory with design.md template\n6. Add README.md explaining this uses The-Pocket/PocketFlow framework\n7. Set up .gitignore for Python projects

## Implementation Notes

- Created the core PocketFlow structure with nodes.py, flow.py, and main.py
- Implemented base Node class with abstract execute method
- Created Flow class with graph execution logic including dependency management
- Added placeholder node classes for all planned nodes (to be implemented in subsequent tasks)
- Created main.py with CLI interface and MainOrchestrator class
- Set up utils/ package with __init__.py for future utility modules
- Created comprehensive docs/design.md outlining system architecture and data flow
- Added README.md with clear framework disambiguation and project overview
- Configured .gitignore for Python projects with project-specific exclusions
- All files follow PocketFlow's minimalist philosophy with clear separation of concerns
