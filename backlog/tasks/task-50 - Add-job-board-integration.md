## Description

Currently users must manually provide job URLs. Adding integration with popular job boards would streamline the workflow by allowing users to search and import jobs directly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Research APIs for major job boards:
  - LinkedIn Jobs API
  - Indeed API
  - Glassdoor API
  - AngelList/Wellfound API
- [ ] Create utils/job_board_connectors.py
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Parse job listings into standard format
- [ ] Add job monitoring for new postings
- [ ] Create JobSearchNode for the workflow
- [ ] Store saved searches and alerts
- [ ] Handle API authentication and rate limits
- [ ] Add tests with mocked API responses
- [ ] Document setup and usage

## Implementation Plan

1. Research available APIs and their limitations
2. Design abstraction layer for multiple job boards
3. Implement connector for each supported board
4. Create unified search interface
5. Add job parsing and normalization
6. Implement monitoring/alert system
7. Update CLI to support job search
8. Add comprehensive tests
9. Create setup documentation

## Notes

Benefits:
- Automated job discovery
- Batch application processing
- Track application status
- Avoid duplicate applications
- Market insights from job trends

Note: Some job boards may require paid API access or have strict rate limits.
