## Description

Create WebSearchNode, ReadContentNode, and SynthesizeInfoNode that execute the tools selected by DecideActionNode. These nodes are simple wrappers around utility functions but follow PocketFlow Node lifecycle. They receive parameters from DecideActionNode, execute the appropriate utility, and update shared store with results. This separation maintains clean architecture between decision logic and tool execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] WebSearchNode class calls utils/web_search.py with query parameter
- [x] ReadContentNode class calls utils/web_scraper.py with URL parameter
- [x] SynthesizeInfoNode uses LLM to extract specific info from text
- [x] All nodes follow prep/exec/post lifecycle pattern
- [x] Nodes read action parameters from shared store
- [x] Search results saved to shared['search_results']
- [x] Scraped content saved to shared['current_content']
- [x] Synthesized info updates shared['company_research']
- [x] Unit tests written for all three node classes
- [x] Tests verify proper utility function calls with correct parameters
- [x] Tests validate shared store updates with expected data structures
- [x] Error handling tests for utility failures
- [x] Mock-based tests to isolate node behavior from external dependencies

## Implementation Plan

1. Create WebSearchNode class using web_search utility
2. Create ReadContentNode class using web_scraper utility
3. Create SynthesizeInfoNode with LLM prompt for extraction
4. Implement prep() to read action parameters
5. Implement exec() to call respective utilities
6. Implement post() to save results to shared store
7. Each node returns to DecideActionNode for next decision
8. Add error handling for utility failures

## Implementation Notes & Findings

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Async Handling in WebSearchNode**: The WebSearcher utility is async, so we needed to create a new event loop within the sync exec() method to run the async search operation.

2. **Action Parameter Reading**: All tool nodes read parameters from `shared["action_params"]` which is populated by DecideActionNode.

3. **Return Action**: All tool nodes return "decide" to create the loop back to DecideActionNode for the next decision.

4. **Data Storage Patterns**:
   - WebSearchNode: Stores results in both `shared["search_results"]` and appends to `shared["research_state"]["information_gathered"]["search_results"]`
   - ReadContentNode: Stores content in `shared["current_content"]` and URL in `shared["current_url"]`
   - SynthesizeInfoNode: Updates `shared["company_research"]` with structured insights

### Testing Challenges

1. **Mocking Async Code**: Testing WebSearchNode required careful mocking of asyncio event loops and the WebSearcher context manager.

2. **LLM Wrapper Mocking**: All nodes that use LLM (DecideActionNode, SynthesizeInfoNode) require mocking `get_default_llm_wrapper` to avoid API key requirements in tests.

3. **Utility Function Imports**: Tests need to patch at the correct import location (e.g., `utils.web_search.WebSearcher` not `nodes.WebSearcher`).

### Integration Points

- All nodes follow the PocketFlow 3-step pattern (prep/exec/post)
- Nodes are designed to be stateless and reusable
- Error handling logs failures but returns safe defaults to keep the flow running
