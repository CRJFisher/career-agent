## Description

The design document mentions "SQLite: Optional for career database storage" but currently the system only supports YAML file storage. Adding SQLite support would enable better querying capabilities, versioning, and handling of larger career databases.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create utils/database_backend.py with abstract storage interface
- [ ] Implement YAMLBackend (refactor existing functionality)
- [ ] Implement SQLiteBackend with:
  - Schema creation from career database structure
  - CRUD operations
  - Query capabilities (search by skills, date ranges, etc.)
  - Migration support for schema changes
- [ ] Update career_database_parser.py to support both backends
- [ ] Add configuration option to choose storage backend
- [ ] Provide migration tool from YAML to SQLite
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for SQLite backend
- [ ] Document database setup and usage

## Implementation Plan

1. Design database schema matching career database structure
2. Create abstract storage interface
3. Refactor existing YAML functionality into YAMLBackend
4. Implement SQLiteBackend with full CRUD
5. Add query methods for common searches
6. Create migration utilities
7. Update configuration system
8. Add tests and documentation

## Notes

Benefits:
- Better performance for large career databases
- Advanced querying capabilities
- Data integrity with constraints
- Version history tracking
- Concurrent access support
