## Description

Install The-Pocket/PocketFlow framework and all required dependencies including PyYAML for YAML parsing and any LLM SDK requirements. PocketFlow is a minimalist framework that avoids bloat and vendor lock-in. The core is just 100 lines modeling LLM apps as directed graphs. Must ensure we're installing from the correct repository (The-Pocket/PocketFlow) which provides Node lifecycle (prep/exec/post), Flow orchestration, and Shared Store patterns.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The-Pocket/PocketFlow framework installed from correct repository
- [ ] PyYAML installed for career database parsing
- [ ] LLM SDK configured (OpenAI/Anthropic/etc)
- [ ] requests library for web utilities
- [ ] beautifulsoup4 for web scraping
- [ ] All dependencies documented in requirements.txt
- [ ] Virtual environment created and activated
- [ ] Installation instructions in README.md

## Implementation Plan

1. Create Python virtual environment\n2. Install PocketFlow from The-Pocket/PocketFlow repository\n3. Install PyYAML for YAML parsing\n4. Install LLM SDK (determine which - OpenAI, Anthropic, etc)\n5. Install requests for web search utility\n6. Install beautifulsoup4 for web scraping\n7. Create requirements.txt with all dependencies\n8. Document installation process
