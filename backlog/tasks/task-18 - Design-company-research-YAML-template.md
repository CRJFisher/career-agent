## Description

Define the structured format for company research output including mission, team scope, strategic importance, and culture fields. This YAML template guides the research agent's information gathering and ensures comprehensive company understanding. The template must capture both factual information (mission, team details) and analytical insights (strategic importance, culture). This structured output feeds into later phases for tailored application materials.
