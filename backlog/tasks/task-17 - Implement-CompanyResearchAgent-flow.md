## Description

Create the looping agent flow that orchestrates company research using DecideActionNode and tool nodes until research is complete. This implements the canonical agentic loop from PocketFlow documentation where a central decision node directs traffic to tool nodes and loops back for re-evaluation. The agent iterates until DecideActionNode returns 'finish' action, gradually populating the company_research template with mission, team_scope, strategic_importance, and culture information.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] CompanyResearchAgent flow created inheriting from Flow
- [x] Looping structure with DecideActionNode at center
- [x] All tool nodes connected with bidirectional edges to DecideNode
- [x] Action-based routing: search->WebSearchNode read->ReadContentNode etc
- [x] Research template populated incrementally in shared['company_research']
- [x] Agent continues until all template fields filled
- [x] Finish action breaks loop and completes flow
- [x] Maximum iteration limit to prevent infinite loops
- [x] Unit tests for flow initialization and graph construction
- [x] Integration tests for complete research agent execution
- [x] Tests verify correct action routing to appropriate nodes
- [x] Tests validate iterative template population
- [x] Tests ensure proper loop termination conditions
- [x] Tests verify maximum iteration safety limits

## Implementation Plan

1. Create CompanyResearchAgent class in flow.py
2. Initialize DecideActionNode and all tool nodes
3. Define cyclic flow graph with DecideNode as hub
4. Map actions: 'search'->WebSearchNode, 'read'->ReadContentNode
5. Map 'synthesize'->SynthesizeInfoNode, 'finish'->end
6. All tool nodes return to DecideActionNode
7. Implement iteration counter for safety
8. Return completed research in shared store

## Implementation Notes & Findings

### Architecture Insights

1. **PocketFlow Integration**: Initially attempted to override `run()` method, but discovered PocketFlow's Flow class has its own orchestration logic. Solution was to override `get_next_node()` instead to implement iteration limiting while leveraging built-in flow execution.

2. **Loop Structure**: Used PocketFlow's edge notation:

   ```python
   decide - "web_search" >> web_search
   web_search - "decide" >> decide
   ```

   This creates bidirectional connections where actions determine routing.

3. **Iteration Safety**: Implemented iteration counting in `get_next_node()` rather than in flow execution, ensuring clean integration with PocketFlow's orchestration.

### Research Template Design

The agent initializes a comprehensive research template:

```python
{
    "mission": None,
    "team_scope": None,
    "strategic_importance": None,
    "culture": None,
    "technology_stack_practices": None,
    "recent_developments": None,
    "market_position_growth": None
}
```

### Testing Approach

1. **Flow Graph Verification**: Tests verify node connections by checking `successors` dictionary on each node.

2. **Mock Strategy**: All tests mock LLM wrapper at the fixture level to avoid API key requirements.

3. **Integration Testing**: Created tests that exercise the full flow with mocked LLM responses to verify proper action routing.

### Key Learnings

1. **Flow Termination**: Two ways to exit the loop:
   - DecideActionNode returns "finish" action
   - Iteration count exceeds maximum

2. **State Management**: Research state is incrementally built up across iterations, with each tool node contributing to `information_gathered`.

3. **Error Resilience**: The flow continues even if individual tool nodes fail, logging errors but not breaking the loop.

### Future Enhancements

- Could add priority-based research (focus on missing template fields)
- Could implement backtracking if research goes off-track
- Could add research quality assessment before finishing
