## Description

Define the structure for the narrative strategy output including career arc, key messages, must-tell experiences, differentiators, and evidence stories. This data structure serves as the blueprint for material generation, containing both strategic decisions (which experiences to highlight) and tactical content (specific stories and messages). The structure must support the 5-part cover letter format and guide CV generation.
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Narrative strategy schema with all components defined
- [ ] Career arc structure with past/present/future components
- [ ] Key messages array with 3 concise powerful statements
- [ ] Must-tell experiences list with rationale for selection
- [ ] Differentiators list highlighting unique value
- [ ] Evidence stories in detailed CAR format
- [ ] Integration points with CV and cover letter generation
- [ ] Example narrative strategy with populated data
