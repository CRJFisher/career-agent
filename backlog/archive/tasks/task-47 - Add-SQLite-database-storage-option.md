## Description

The design document mentions "SQLite: Optional for career database storage" but currently the system only supports YAML file storage. Adding SQLite support would enable better querying capabilities, versioning, and handling of larger career databases.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create utils/database_backend.py with abstract storage interface
- [x] Implement YAMLBackend (refactor existing functionality)
- [x] Implement SQLiteBackend with:
  - Schema creation from career database structure
  - CRUD operations
  - Query capabilities (search by skills, date ranges, etc.)
  - Migration support for schema changes
- [x] Update career_database_parser.py to support both backends
- [x] Add configuration option to choose storage backend
- [x] Provide migration tool from YAML to SQLite
- [x] Create comprehensive tests for SQLite backend
- [x] Document database setup and usage

## Implementation Plan

1. Design database schema matching career database structure
2. Create abstract storage interface
3. Refactor existing YAML functionality into YAMLBackend
4. Implement SQLiteBackend with full CRUD
5. Add query methods for common searches
6. Create migration utilities
7. Update configuration system
8. Add tests and documentation

## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **utils/database_backend.py** - Abstract storage interface with YAMLBackend and SQLiteBackend implementations
   - `StorageBackend` ABC with save/load/exists/delete/backup methods
   - `YAMLBackend` for backward compatibility
   - `SQLiteBackend` with normalized relational schema (10+ tables)
   - Factory function `get_storage_backend()`

2. **utils/database_parser_v2.py** - Enhanced parser with multi-backend support
   - Auto-detection of backend type from file extension
   - Maintains backward compatible API
   - Query capabilities for SQLite backend

3. **utils/database_migration.py** - Migration utilities
   - `DatabaseMigrator` class for bidirectional migration
   - Automatic backup with timestamps
   - Data validation during migration

4. **config/database_config.py** - Configuration management
   - Persistent config in `~/.career-agent/config.json`
   - Environment variable support (`CAREER_DB_BACKEND`)
   - Backend switching with optional data migration

5. **Updated existing files:**
   - `nodes.py` - BuildDatabaseNode uses new parser
   - `main.py` - Added CLI commands for backend management
   - `flow.py` - Updated imports

### CLI Commands Added:
- `--db-info` - Show current backend configuration
- `--db-backend` - Display current backend type  
- `--migrate-db --db-backend <type>` - Migrate between backends

### Database Schema:
- **Core tables**: experiences, education, skills, projects, certifications, publications, awards
- **Relationship tables**: experience_achievements, experience_technologies, experience_projects, etc.
- **Proper foreign keys and indexes for performance**

### Tests:
- 13 comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_sqlite_backend.py`
- Tests for both backends, migration, and edge cases
- All tests passing

### Documentation:
- Created `docs/sqlite_backend.md` with usage examples, performance considerations, and troubleshooting

## Notes

Benefits achieved:

- Better performance for large career databases
- Advanced querying capabilities
- Data integrity with constraints
- Version history tracking (through backups)
- Concurrent access support
- Seamless migration between backends
- Full backward compatibility
