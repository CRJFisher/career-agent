## Description

Create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to expose the Career Application Agent as a sub-agent that can be used by other AI assistants like Claude Code. MCP is an open standard by Anthropic that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs, essentially acting as a "USB-C port for AI applications". This would allow the career agent's capabilities to be seamlessly integrated into coding workflows, IDEs, and other AI-powered tools.

**Critical**: The implementation must support two modes of operation:

1. **MCP Sampling Mode**: When running as an MCP server, leverage the `sampling` protocol to request that the client performs LLM tasks. This allows the server to delegate all LLM operations to the client without requiring its own API keys.
2. **Standalone Mode**: When running independently (not as MCP server), use traditional token-based authentication with LLM providers. This maintains backward compatibility and allows direct CLI usage.

The system should automatically detect which mode to use based on the execution context.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Research and understand MCP specification, especially the sampling protocol
- [x] Install MCP Python SDK (`pip install mcp`)
- [x] Create `mcp_server.py` that exposes career agent as MCP server
- [x] **Implement dual-mode LLM operations**:
  - Create adaptive wrapper that supports both MCP sampling and direct API calls
  - Detect execution context to choose appropriate mode
  - In MCP mode: Route LLM calls through sampling requests
  - In standalone mode: Use existing token-based authentication
  - Maintain conversation context across both modes
  - Handle sampling responses and API errors appropriately
- [x] Implement MCP tools for key capabilities:
  - Build career database from documents
  - Analyze job requirements
  - Generate tailored CV/cover letter
  - Research company information
  - Get application recommendations
- [x] Add MCP resources for:
  - Career database access
  - Generated documents
  - Analysis results
- [x] Create MCP prompts for common workflows
- [x] Implement proper error handling and logging
- [x] Add configuration for MCP server settings
- [x] Create integration tests for MCP endpoints
- [x] Write documentation for MCP usage and sampling
- [x] Create example claude_desktop_config.json
- [x] Test integration with Claude Desktop
- [x] Ensure human approval for sensitive sampling requests

## Implementation Plan

1. **Setup MCP Environment**
   - Install MCP Python SDK
   - Study MCP documentation and examples
   - Set up development environment for testing

2. **Design MCP Interface**
   - Map career agent workflows to MCP tools
   - Define tool parameters and return types
   - Design resource structure for data access

3. **Implement Core MCP Server with Sampling**

   ```python
   from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
   from mcp.types import SamplingRequest, Message
   
   mcp = FastMCP("career-agent")
   
   @mcp.tool()
   async def analyze_job(job_url: str, job_description: str = None) -> dict:
       """Analyze a job posting and provide tailored application recommendations"""
       # Use sampling to request LLM analysis
       sampling_request = SamplingRequest(
           messages=[
               Message(role="user", content=f"Analyze this job posting: {job_url}")
           ],
           model_preferences={"temperature": 0.7}
       )
       response = await mcp.sample(sampling_request)
       # Process response and return structured data
   
   @mcp.tool()
   async def generate_cv(job_url: str, template: str = "default") -> str:
       """Generate a tailored CV for a specific job"""
       # Use sampling for CV generation
       sampling_request = SamplingRequest(
           messages=[
               Message(role="system", content="You are a CV generation expert"),
               Message(role="user", content=f"Generate CV for job: {job_url}")
           ]
       )
       response = await mcp.sample(sampling_request)
       return response.content
   ```

4. **Implement MCP Tools**
   - `build_database`: Scan documents and build career database
   - `analyze_job`: Extract requirements and analyze fit
   - `research_company`: Gather company information
   - `generate_cv`: Create tailored CV
   - `generate_cover_letter`: Create cover letter
   - `get_recommendations`: Provide application strategy

5. **Add MCP Resources**
   - Career database YAML
   - Job analysis results
   - Generated documents
   - Company research findings

6. **Create MCP Prompts**
   - "Help me apply to this job"
   - "Update my career database"
   - "Analyze my fit for this role"
   - "Research this company"

7. **Integration Configuration**
   - Create example configurations for:
     - Claude Desktop
     - Cursor IDE
     - Custom AI agents
   - Document security considerations

## Technical Considerations

### Dual-Mode Architecture

- **MCP Mode**: Route all LLM operations through MCP sampling when running as server
- **Standalone Mode**: Use existing LLMWrapper with API tokens when running directly
- Create an adaptive LLMWrapper that switches between modes
- Detect execution context to determine appropriate mode
- Maintain prompt templates and conversation context in both modes
- Handle sampling request approvals/rejections in MCP mode

### MCP Architecture

- Server exposes tools, resources, and prompts
- Clients (Claude Desktop, IDEs) connect via JSON-RPC
- Stateless design for scalability
- Proper authentication and authorization

### Integration Points

- Create `MCPLLMWrapper` class that implements the same interface as `LLMWrapper`
- Route all node LLM calls through sampling requests
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing nodes
- Async support for long-running operations
- Progress callbacks for UI updates

### Implementation Strategy

```python
class AdaptiveLLMWrapper:
    """LLM wrapper that adapts between MCP sampling and direct API calls"""
    
    def __init__(self, mcp_context=None):
        self.mcp_context = mcp_context
        self.standalone_wrapper = None
        
        if not mcp_context:
            # Standalone mode - use traditional wrapper
            from utils.llm_wrapper import get_default_llm_wrapper
            self.standalone_wrapper = get_default_llm_wrapper()
    
    async def generate(self, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str:
        """Generate response using appropriate method"""
        if self.mcp_context:
            # MCP mode - use sampling
            sampling_request = SamplingRequest(
                messages=[Message(role="user", content=prompt)],
                model_preferences=kwargs
            )
            response = await self.mcp_context.sample(sampling_request)
            return response.content
        else:
            # Standalone mode - use direct API
            return await self.standalone_wrapper.generate(prompt, **kwargs)
    
    async def generate_structured(self, prompt: str, schema: dict) -> dict:
        """Generate structured response using appropriate method"""
        if self.mcp_context:
            # Include schema in prompt for MCP sampling
            enhanced_prompt = f"{prompt}\n\nReturn response as JSON matching: {schema}"
            return await self.generate(enhanced_prompt)
        else:
            # Use standalone wrapper's structured generation
            return await self.standalone_wrapper.generate_structured(prompt, schema)
```

### Security

- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize file paths
- Implement permission controls
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Request human approval for sensitive sampling operations

## Example Usage

Once implemented, users could:

1. In Claude Code:

   ```
   "I found this job posting [URL]. Can you help me apply?"
   -> Career agent analyzes job, generates tailored documents
   ```

2. In Cursor IDE:

   ```
   "Update my career database with this project I just completed"
   -> Scans code, extracts project details, updates database
   ```

3. In custom agent:

   ```python
   # Use career agent as sub-agent
   result = await mcp_client.call_tool(
       "analyze_job",
       {"job_url": "https://example.com/job"}
   )
   ```
