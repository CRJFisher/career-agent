## Description

Create a node that maps job requirements to personal experiences using RAG pattern to search career database for relevant evidence. This is the first node in the AnalysisFlow and implements a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation where retrieval (searching the database) provides context to generation (creating the mapping). The node must iterate through each requirement and find all potentially relevant pieces of evidence from professional_experience and projects sections.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] RequirementMappingNode class created in nodes.py following Node lifecycle
- [x] prep reads requirements from shared['requirements'] and career_db
- [x] RAG search functionality implemented for evidence retrieval
- [x] Searches both professional_experience and projects sections
- [x] Supports keyword matching for initial implementation
- [ ] Semantic search capability planned for enhancement
- [x] Raw mapping saved to shared['requirement_mapping_raw']
- [x] Each requirement mapped to list of potential evidence
- [x] Unit tests created for all public methods
- [x] Test coverage of at least 80%
- [x] Mock-based testing for external dependencies (career_db, shared store)
- [x] Error cases tested (empty requirements, missing career_db, search failures)
- [x] Edge cases tested (no matches found, malformed data)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create RequirementMappingNode class with PocketFlow Node interface
2. Implement prep() to load requirements and career database
3. Design retrieval logic to search career_db for each requirement
4. Implement keyword matching across experience descriptions
5. Search both professional_experience and projects for evidence
6. Create mapping structure: {requirement: [evidence_list]}
7. Implement post() to save raw mapping to shared store
8. Return 'continue' action for flow progression

## Completion Summary

**Completed on**: 2025-08-01

### Implementation Details

- Implemented RequirementMappingNode with full RAG pattern support
- Added keyword-based search with both exact and partial matching (50% word overlap threshold)
- Searches across all career database sections:
  - Experience entries (title, description, achievements, technologies)
  - Nested projects within experience entries
  - Standalone projects section
  - Skills section
- Handles various requirement types: lists, dictionaries, and single values
- Calculates coverage score based on requirements matched
- Results limited to top 5 evidence items per requirement, sorted by match quality

### Key Features

1. **Extraction**: `_extract_searchable_content()` flattens career database into searchable text blocks
2. **Search**: `_search_for_evidence()` performs keyword matching with exact/partial detection
3. **Coverage**: Tracks total vs mapped requirements for scoring
4. **Flexibility**: Handles nested project structure from enhanced career database schema

### Test Coverage

- Created comprehensive test suite with 21 tests
- All tests passing with mocked LLM wrapper
- Covers all acceptance criteria including edge cases
- Tests verify correct behavior for empty data, missing sections, and various requirement formats

### Notes

- Changed from `shared['job_requirements_structured']` to `shared['requirements']` for consistency
- Semantic search capability left as future enhancement
- Coverage score helps downstream nodes prioritize gap analysis
