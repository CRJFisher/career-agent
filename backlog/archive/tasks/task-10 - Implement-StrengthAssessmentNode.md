## Description

Create a node that evaluates the strength of requirement-to-evidence mappings using LLM to assign HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW scores. This node performs qualitative synthesis by analyzing how well each piece of evidence demonstrates the required skill. HIGH means direct and powerful demonstration, MEDIUM shows related experience, LOW indicates weak or indirect link. This assessment is crucial for identifying gaps and prioritizing experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] StrengthAssessmentNode class created following Node lifecycle
- [x] prep reads raw mapping from shared['requirement_mapping_raw']
- [x] Iterates through each requirement and its evidence list
- [x] LLM prompt for qualitative strength assessment implemented
- [x] Assigns HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW scores based on match quality
- [x] Prompt template includes requirement evidence and scoring criteria
- [x] Assessed mapping saved to shared['requirement_mapping_assessed']
- [x] Maintains original evidence with added strength scores
- [x] Unit tests created for all public methods
- [x] Test coverage of at least 80%
- [x] Mock-based testing for external dependencies (LLM calls, shared store)
- [x] Error cases tested (LLM failures, empty mappings, malformed responses)
- [x] Edge cases tested (invalid scores, missing evidence data)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create StrengthAssessmentNode class inheriting from Node
2. Implement prep() to read raw requirement mappings
3. Design LLM prompt for strength assessment
4. Include scoring criteria in prompt (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW definitions)
5. Iterate through each requirement-evidence pair
6. Call LLM to assess match strength
7. Update mapping structure with strength scores
8. Save assessed mapping to shared store in post()

## Completion Summary

**Completed on**: 2025-08-01

### Implementation Details

- Implemented StrengthAssessmentNode with LLM-based strength scoring
- Handles both dict-type requirements (skills, responsibilities) and single-value requirements
- Uses focused prompt that includes requirement, evidence type, title, and match type
- Clear scoring criteria provided to LLM for consistent assessment
- Preserves all original evidence fields while adding "strength" field
- Defaults to MEDIUM score on errors or invalid responses for robustness

### Key Features

1. **Flexible Structure Handling**: Processes nested dict requirements and single-value list requirements
2. **Focused Prompts**: Minimal prompt with only essential information for assessment
3. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of LLM errors and invalid responses
4. **Evidence Preservation**: Maintains complete evidence structure with added strength score

### Test Coverage

- Created comprehensive test suite with 16 tests
- All tests passing with mocked LLM wrapper
- Covers all acceptance criteria including error cases
- Tests verify correct handling of complex nested mappings

### Notes

- Case-insensitive score validation (accepts "high", "HIGH", etc.)
- Logs warnings for invalid scores and errors for LLM failures
- Empty evidence lists are preserved as empty in the assessed mapping
