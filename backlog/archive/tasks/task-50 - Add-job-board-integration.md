## Description

Currently users must manually provide job URLs. This task will create an autonomous scraping agent that can intelligently discover job listings from a set of root URLs. Rather than relying on APIs (which are often limited or paid), the agent will crawl job board sites to find relevant opportunities based on the user's career profile.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Research & Tool Selection

- [x] Evaluate scraping tools from task-45 research for job discovery:
  - LangChain browser tools (already integrated)
  - Firecrawl (gather-focused scraping)
  - ScrapeGraphAI (LLM-powered extraction)
  - Custom Playwright/BeautifulSoup solution
- [x] Research job board structures:
  - LinkedIn job listings structure
  - Indeed search patterns
  - Glassdoor pagination
  - AngelList/Wellfound layouts
- [x] Choose optimal tool(s) based on:
  - Ability to handle dynamic content
  - Pattern recognition capabilities
  - Scalability for multiple sites
  - Integration with existing architecture

### Phase 2: Core Implementation

- [x] Create `JobDiscoveryAgent` flow with:
  - `InitializeSearchNode`: Set search parameters from career profile
  - `CrawlJobBoardNode`: Navigate and discover job listing pages
  - `ExtractJobListingsNode`: Extract job details from pages
  - `FilterRelevantJobsNode`: Score jobs against career profile
  - `DeduplicateJobsNode`: Avoid duplicate discoveries
  - `SaveJobsNode`: Store discovered jobs with metadata
- [x] Implement intelligent crawling strategies:
  - Breadth-first search from root URLs
  - Dynamic depth adjustment based on relevance
  - Respect robots.txt and rate limits
  - Session management for login-required sites
- [x] Create job extraction schemas for each board
- [x] Add relevance scoring based on career database

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- [ ] Implement adaptive search refinement:
  - Learn from user feedback on suggested jobs
  - Adjust search parameters automatically
  - Identify patterns in successful applications
- [ ] Add monitoring capabilities:
  - Schedule periodic searches
  - Track new postings since last run
  - Alert on high-relevance opportunities
- [ ] Create batch processing for discovered jobs
- [ ] Add export to various formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)

## Implementation Plan

   - Design JobDiscoveryAgent flow
   - Create node interfaces
   - Define shared state structure
   - Plan crawling strategies

3. **Core Implementation** (3-5 days)
   - Implement base nodes
   - Add support for 2-3 major job boards
   - Create extraction templates
   - Build relevance scoring

4. **Testing & Refinement** (2-3 days)
   - Test on real job boards
   - Handle edge cases
   - Optimize performance
   - Add comprehensive tests

## Technical Considerations

### Agentic Approach Benefits

- **Autonomous Discovery**: Agent decides what to crawl based on relevance
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Learns from discovered patterns
- **No API Limitations**: Bypasses rate limits and paid tiers
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any job board with web interface
- **Intelligence**: Uses LLM to understand job relevance

### Tool Comparison (from Task-45 Research)

1. **LangChain Browser Tools** (Currently Integrated)
   - ✅ Already set up in our codebase
   - ✅ Good for navigation and form filling
   - ❓ May need enhancement for bulk crawling
   - Consider: Extending with custom tools

2. **Firecrawl**
   - ✅ Designed for gathering content at scale
   - ✅ Handles JavaScript-heavy sites
   - ✅ Built-in LLM-ready formatting
   - ❓ May need custom integration
   - Consider: For high-volume discovery

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Use Firecrawl for bulk discovery
   - Use LangChain tools for detailed extraction
   - Combine strengths of both approaches

### Crawling Strategy

```python
class JobDiscoveryAgent:
    """
    Autonomous agent for discovering job opportunities.
    
    Given root URLs like:
    - https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=software+engineer
    - https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=python+developer
    
    The agent will:
    1. Crawl pagination to find all job listings
    2. Extract job details (title, company, description)
    3. Score relevance against career profile
    4. Track already-seen jobs
    5. Return ranked opportunities
    """
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Stateful Crawling**: Maintain crawl state to resume interrupted searches
2. **Profile-Driven**: Use career database to guide search priorities
3. **Multi-Board**: Abstract interface for different job board structures
4. **Respectful**: Honor robots.txt and implement polite delays
5. **Incremental**: Support both full and delta crawls

## Benefits

- **Proactive Discovery**: Find jobs before they're widely seen
- **Personalized Matching**: Score based on individual career profile
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Crawl multiple boards simultaneously
- **Time Efficiency**: Automate the job search process
- **Strategic Insights**: Identify market trends and opportunities
- **Batch Processing**: Apply to multiple matched jobs efficiently

## Example Usage

```bash
# Discover jobs from configured root URLs
python main.py discover-jobs --profile software-engineer --location "San Francisco"

# Monitor for new postings
python main.py monitor-jobs --frequency daily --min-score 0.8

# Batch process discovered jobs
python main.py batch-apply --discovered-jobs output/discovered_jobs.json
```

## Success Metrics

- Number of relevant jobs discovered per crawl
- Precision: % of discovered jobs worth applying to
- Recall: % of available relevant jobs found
- Time saved vs manual searching
- Application success rate from discovered jobs
