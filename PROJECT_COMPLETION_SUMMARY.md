```

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Set up environment**:

   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key"
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Build career database**:

   ```bash
   python main.py build-database --source-dir ~/Documents/Career
   ```

3. **Apply to jobs**:

   ```bash
   python main.py apply --job-url "..." --company "..."
   ```

## Usage Options

1. **CLI Interface**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --demo  # Try demo mode
   python main.py --db-backend sqlite --migrate-db  # Use SQLite
   ```

2. **Web Interface**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up  # Launch web app
   # Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **MCP Integration**:
   ```json
   // Add to claude_desktop_config.json
   {
     "career-agent": {
       "command": "python",
       "args": ["/path/to/mcp_server.py"]
     }
   }
   ```
